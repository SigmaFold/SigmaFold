# SigmaFold

Recent and considerable discoveries regarding conformational analysis of proteins formulated from its amino acid sequence has assisted and expediated research progression in this field. As a long-range goal, our group is interested in Computational Protein Design, denoted as the ‘Inverse Protein Folding Problem’, and aims to predict a protein’s primary sequence from its tertiary structure to aid de novo protein synthesis. We are interested in defining heuristic rules for protein folding using simplified models; for a given shape, we intend to delineate the optimal sequences that encompass the desired conformation as the protein’s native fold.
