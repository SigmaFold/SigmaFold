<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction

Inverse protein folding is the problem of finding the structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence. In this project, we are using the HP lattice model to approach the 2D inverse protein folding problem. The HP lattice model is a simple model in which the protein sequence is represented as a string of two types of amino acids, H and P, with H representing hydrophobic (water-fearing) residues and P representing hydrophilic (water-loving) residues.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Approaches

In this project, we are proposing two approaches to solve the inverse protein folding problem:


### Placing Algorithm

The placing algorithm takes as input a Hamiltonian path, corresponding to a desired shape of the protein, and learns to place Hs and Ps in strategic locations to get the sequence with the minimum degeneracy. This will be done using Deep Reinforcement Learning, and a training dataset will be used to define its reward function. The idea is to find all heuristic rules that encompass the placement of Hs and Ps on the lattice and use that to extrapolate to higher sequence lengths. This algorithm uses Deep Q-Learning, and a custom dataset that we have generated and stored on Supabase.

### Tweaking Algorithm

The tweaking algorithm is similar to the placing algorithm, although it takes as input a sequence that is "close to the goal" and tweaks specific Hs or Ps to improve the overall sequence.

## Prerequisites
