Folders:

1 - extrapolation_test 
    fov = 1, max_attempts = 1
    1M timesteps 
    trained only on 14
        => gives a model (use for validation)
    validated with 15 and 16
        => gives json files (to do histograms of uncleared shapes)
    NOTE: json saving failed however everything else was fine. For this test it doesn't matter. model saved correctly.
    
2 - gigamodel 
    6M timesteps
    fov = 1, 2, 5, 10 
    trained on everything
        => one json per fov (for histograms)
        => one graph per fov (to find optimal fov)
        => one model per fov (?)

3 - max_attempt_test
    fov = 1
    max_attemps = 1, 100, 10000
    1M timesteps

4 - random_agent_test 
    1 random agent.
    Benchmark against max_attempt_test fov=1
    

Target graphs:
1 - Extrapolation capacity 
2 - nb of attempts vs complexity 
3 - Learning vs random
4 - fovTest (learning curve)
5 - Effect of max_attempts (?)
